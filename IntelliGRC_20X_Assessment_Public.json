Network Security Groups (NSGs) are configured with a default deny-all rule, allowing traffic between subnets strictly by exception. This approach helps prevent unauthorized lateral movement between network segments. Additional isolation and access controls are provided through Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Just-in-Time (JIT) access policies, which limit administrative exposure and reduce the overall attack surface.
